Those are:\r\n* C# programming, and more specifically, WPF technology\r\n* Git as a mean to control my project\r\n* GitHub as a collaboration and distribution system\r\n\r\n***\r\n\"Shields And Axes\" is a game of \"Tic-tac-toe\" using the viking theme. As of now, main application is fully functional. It supports 1 player vs. CPU and 2 player modes.\r\nIn planning for now is migration of the project to MVVM pattern (that should be interesting) and adding sounds (even more interesting).\r\n\r\n***","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
