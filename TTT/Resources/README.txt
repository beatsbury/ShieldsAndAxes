THIS IS INITIAL BETA RELEASE. STOP THROWING STONES AT ME.
=========================================================

By installing Shields & Axes ("Application" from here on) you are agreeing 
to not hold grudge at me in any possible manner if:
1.	Application fails to exceed your humble expectations; 
2.	Application damages your hard drive, RAM plank, CPU, kettle or any other
	house appliance;
3.	Application seems to chat out using your ISP credentials while you sleep;
4.	Application conducts any kind of revolutionary movements inside your premises
	(e.g. collaborating with your mouse to overthrow your despotic rule, showing 
	your porn folder to your mom etc.)
